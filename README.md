# three-csg, a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) library for three.js

## Overview

Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a modelling technique that uses Boolean operations like union and intersection to combine 3D solids. This library enables you to build 3D objects in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) with a couple of lines of code with ease.

## Notes

This is based on the excellent [jscad/csg.js](https://github.com/jscad/csg.js) library.

This is a work in progress, the code is not optimized.
